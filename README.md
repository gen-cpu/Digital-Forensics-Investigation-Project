## 🔍 Forensic Methodology
The project follows the standard digital forensics process:

1. **Identification**  
   Identifying potential sources of digital evidence.

2. **Preservation**  
   Ensuring data integrity and preventing evidence tampering.

3. **Collection**  
   Acquiring digital data in a forensically sound manner.

4. **Examination**  
   Extracting relevant artifacts such as files, logs, and metadata.

5. **Analysis**  
   Interpreting findings to reconstruct events and activities.

6. **Reporting**  
   Documenting results in a clear forensic report.
